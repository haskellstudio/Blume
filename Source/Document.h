/**The Document class stores all information related to a single window. It 
contains pointers to all the objects held by a window, and, most importantly, a
window and its document are inextricably tied for their lifetimes, so you can
not change the pointer held by the window to the document. You access the 
information in Document by deriving a class from DocumentHandler. By doing this
your derived class immediately will have access to every nook and cranny of the
Blume Document Object Model. Be careful to not cache pointers to any Document
objects indefinitely, as they may change (i.e. during editing). If you decide to
add something to the Document class, make sure to delete it in the proper order
in the Document destructor. For creating the object, add a createObject method
in the Document class and add a getObject method for others to access. Be sure
to make the pointer private so that it is not possible for any other part of the
program to make accidental changes.*/
