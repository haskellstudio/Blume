    derive. The fundamental perk of Belle, Bonne, Sage is that you can
    derive different notation schemes from Portfolio using the base class
    Painter to do all of the drawing. You can then choose an arbitrary
    output by deriving a Painter. Derivations of these classes are to be
    assigned to the abcd namespace ("another bbs context definition", or its
    pet name "abracadabra"). Therefore, notation is never dependent on its
    final representation or vice-versa. This library is dedicated to Gardner
    Read, who once said contrary to the widely held belief: "Music is not
    universal." It is to this seemingly paradoxical statement, that this
    library owes its intention. One can never hope to create a notation (or
    music for that matter) that suits everyone, but one can create a tool
    for allowing new notations to be easily incorporated with existing
