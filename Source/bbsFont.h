  /**\brief Font stores information about a font program already lying around
  somewhere in memory. \details Fonts occupy a tricky classification in the
  Belle, Bonne, Sage library, as each Medium must implement them, but there is
  no generic representation, and each implementation is different. Thankfully,
  the number of representations of fonts is finite, and in fact only a few are
  in widespread use: TrueType, PostScript, and their "universal" descendent,
  OpenType. The prim::typeface namespace is devoted to providing APIs for each
  DescriptionLanguage mentioned above.

  Font, like Belle, Bonne, Sage, is platform-independent. What this means
  practically-speaking is that instead of reading a font from the system cache
  of loaded fonts, you instead supply the font file itself. This approach is
  useful because some output mediums, such as PDF, require the font program
  itself for embedding purposes. Operating systems typically do not give you
  direct access to the font program; rather, they supply a higher level API
  for interacting with it in rendering operations. Also, on most operating
  systems it is possible to load a font from an arbitrary file into its font
  cache. Many programs do this such as PDF readers. Thus, storing the actual
  font program is generally useful for even specialized applications.*/
