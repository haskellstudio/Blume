  This does nothing except delete the object when it goes out of scope.
  Auto-pointers are bound for their lifetime so you can not change what they
  point to after they are set to something. The default constructor will
  automatically create the object (assuming that object also has a valid default
  constructor). You can also assign the object after the constructor by
  initially specifying null for the constructor.*/
