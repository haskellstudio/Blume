  /**\brief Heap is a templated heap allocation and garbage collector with
  special emphasis on fast creation of individual elements. \details It solves
  two common annoyances of C++ programs: fragmentation of the heap over time
  and the inconvenience of having to do a manual 'delete' on items allocated
  through the 'new' operator. As you repeatedly call 'new', C++ must try
  harder and harder to find a free area in its hash table. Also, 'new' calls
  are very expensive computationally if you, for example, allocate a number of
  things all at once that are not contiguous.

  Heap allocates memory only in type unit powers of two. This means that as
  more and more units are allocated, Heap calls the 'new' operator less 
  frequently since the allocation curve anticipates growth.

  Working the opposite way, when units are deallocated, Heap saves a linked 
  deletion tree that traverses through the old locations of each deallocated 
  unit. When the largest power-of-two heap has a full deletion tree, it is 
  automatically collapsed. Since Heap stores the linking pointers in the 
  abandoned memory, the unit width must be greater than or equal to the size of 
  the pointer. Otherwise, Heap forces the allocated units to be at least as 
  large as the size of a pointer. Allocating a heap of chars would thus be
  inefficient. Heap works best with larger types, like links in a linked list. 
  Also, when the deletion tree is active, subsequent calls to New() simply pop 
  an item off that stack instead of increasing the heap's size.

  Allocating and deallocating memory works exactly like it does in plain C++
  memory operations. Call New() to get a pointer to the next new item. Note
  that by design, you can not ask for an array of units. If you need the items
  to be contiguous then use an Array.

  You call Delete(T*& ObjectPointer) with a reference to the object
  pointer. Before it deallocates the memory, it will call the destructor of
  the object if there is one, and then it will zero out your pointer.

  You can also instruct Heap to delete all of the subheaps at once. Doing this
  however does not call the destructors of each object, so make sure you are
  calling it for the right reason (i.e. the object's destructor is irrelevant
  because all the memory is being deleted). To delete in this way call
  DeleteAllWithoutDestructor(). This is also the default behavior of the Heap
  destructor, so the memory just needs to be freed then you can let Heap take 
  care of the garbage collection as it goes out of scope.

  To determine the number of elements in the heap call Size(). Note that by
  design you can not iterate through the elements like an array, which is also
  why you can not delete all of the subheaps and simultaneously call each 
  object's destructor. Heap has no direct knowledge of a unit's existence except
  indirectly through the deletion tree. Iterating would essentially be a
  O(n-squared) operation if it existed under this algorithm.

  Heap comes at a cost of 376 bytes on a 32-bit platform plus the amount of
  data allocated rounded up to the nearest power of two. According to 
  statistical tests, the data structure takes up on average 1.4 times the
  amount it would take up as a single array. However, when used without
  destructors, tests indicate that it is up to 50 times faster than using
  regular new/delete operations and with destructors called, it is
  approximately 2 times faster.

  Heap has a few disadvantages over other memory pool management algorithms.
  Firstly, Heap easily inflates, but deflates only when all units in the largest
  subheap have been deleted. Thus, if you were to randomly delete elements, then
  the size of the heap would not deflate until practically units had been 
  deleted.

  Note: if you need statistical information about the memory, you can derive a
  class from Heap and call the protected statistics methods.*/
