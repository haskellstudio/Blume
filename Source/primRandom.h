  /**A random number generator using the multiply-with-carry algorithm. This
  algorithm produces consistently uniform data and has an extremely long period
  somewhere on the order of 2^64. This particular version of the number 
  generator has been evaluated with the "Dieharder" random number generator test 
  battery and performs extremely well (see results below). The generator
  defaults to seeding with the system clock, so you only need to seed it if you
  want to be able to reproduce a given random sequence.

  A summary page of the results of the Dieharder analysis are as follows:
